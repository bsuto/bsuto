<p>Myrtle Beach is crazy, and the 17 is scary! Also, it&rsquo;s hot outside. So I&rsquo;m taking this stretch through MB a little easier than planned.</p>

<p>North Carolina is behind me now! The border had a few details that jumped out at me. The sign before the state line simply read &ldquo;Bike Lane &mdash; End&rdquo; and then the road immediately went from smooth to impossibly gritty. I hope conditions get better, but odds are they&rsquo;ll stay this way until Georgia.</p>

<p>Soon after the border I merged onto highway 17. I&rsquo;ve been on highways already but this was different: gritty roads, no shoulder, and constant traffic (two lanes&rsquo; worth each direction). So I started walking on the grass at the side of the road pretty much immediately.</p>

<p>The ECG route included a short detour off 17 that made sense on paper &mdash; a reprieve from the stress of a major road &mdash; but the detour&rsquo;s roads were no better and I ended up walking that too. Then back to 17 for more walking until I could take the bypass to Myrtle Beach.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s both awesome and frustrating to have Ocean Blvd be a part of the ECG. Awesome to have the ocean right there, frustrating to have a bunch of people and boardwalk shops right there too. More walking mixed in with slow skateboarding. I&rsquo;m calling it for the day, and spending my Friday night in party city (asleep).</p>
