<p>Fifty miles! When I watched the sun rise this morning from my baller hotel room, I knew that was ahead of me but didn&rsquo;t really know what it&rsquo;d feel like. It could be the distance in general, but I posit that going over thousands of jolting sidewalk cracks caused more aches than some previous days put together.</p>

<p>On the positive side, I got confirmation of double digit speed today! One of those speed limit / your actual speed signs flickered between 10 and 11 as I went by, though it was admittedly on a slight decline. Later, a man out for exercise on his bicycle caught up to me, and said &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been tailing you for a while, you&rsquo;re going ten to eleven miles per hour!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tomorrow will be my last day, and a relatively easy one compared to these last couple (hopefully). Like this morning, I know that&rsquo;s ahead of me but I doubt I can predict what it&rsquo;ll feel like to finish.</p>
