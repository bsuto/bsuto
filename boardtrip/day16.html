<h1>Day 16: Hollywood &mdash; Yemassee</h1>

<p>My original goal was 40 miles a day, which was feasible at the beginning, with cooler temperatures and better road surfaces. But I struggled today to hit 40, spending almost ten hours on the road and a lot of that walking.</p>

<p>I read <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/seanwilsey/more-like-a-metaphor">an awesome article</a> the other day about the author&rsquo;s personal history and connection to skateboarding; there was a passage where he called out the people who walk up hills rather than rough it out on the board. I&rsquo;ll own up to being quick to walk on this trip because I&rsquo;m in it for distance and endurance, and when pushing on the board goes no quicker than walking at 2&ndash;3 times the effort, of course I&rsquo;m gonna walk. Maybe my legs aren&rsquo;t strong enough yet.</p>

<p>For the rest of SC, I&rsquo;ll reduce my goal to 30 miles a day and see how that goes. Hopefully Georgia has better roads! I&rsquo;ll be glad to get away from the 17 forever.</p>

<p>I stopped for a soda at Road Side Grocery in Yemassee before reaching my final destination. The friendly woman behind the counter said she&rsquo;d seen a lot of bikes go by, but mine was the first skateboard. One customer kept coming into the store from the picnic benches out back to make sure he wasn&rsquo;t seeing things: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s wild, man! Wild.&rdquo; Four times in a row. Another guy pulled up, parked his car, gave me a once-over, and simply said &ldquo;all right&rdquo; before going inside.</p>

<p>Before I set out again, &ldquo;wild!&rdquo; man came by one more time. &ldquo;You gotta be on drugs to be doing this, man!&rdquo; I assured him I wasn&rsquo;t, he asked if I ever did, I answered, and he offered to sell me weed on the spot. What a generous fella!</p>
