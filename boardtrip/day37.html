<p>One thing about camping, especially solo, is that your circadian rhythm really takes over. I started trying to fall asleep shortly after sunset last night, and woke up a little bit before sunrise this morning. It didn&rsquo;t hurt that I was also eager to get back on the road.</p>

<p>The Naval Air Station outside Key West was putting on a show (or training, sure) as I passed. Three fighter jets kept taking off, circling, and landing right over my head, completely drowning out my headphones. I came close to drifting out of the shoulder and into the traffic lane as my head rolled back to follow them across the sky.</p>

<p>I reached the island with still a lot of morning left, and around mile marker 3, I ran into a breast cancer 5K walk. Looking and smelling dirty, trying to weave through a sea of slower-moving pink, was not how I envisioned finishing this trip, but you take what you get.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m done! Two installments to skateboard from Durham to Key West, and no cheating by car whatsoever this time. Will I tackle the northern half of the East Coast Greenway? I dunno. The first order of business is to throw away these shoes. They may have carried me these 1000+ miles and given me questionable tan lines, but they are falling apart and also gave me some serious blisters. And then I&rsquo;ll enjoy the island for a couple days. No doubt it&rsquo;s all been worth it.</p>
