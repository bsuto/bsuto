<p>Today is really a combination rest and celebration day. There are plenty of people who&rsquo;ve heard I&rsquo;m &ldquo;skateboarding to Florida,&rdquo; and as far as they&rsquo;re concerned, I&rsquo;ve done it!</p>

<p>The morning was easy, some Georgia back roads and then the 17, over a big blue bridge (which was closed until recently, according to the ECG) into the sunshine state. I continued along the 17 until Yulee. This stretch was also recently paved, but they hadn&rsquo;t gotten to the shoulders yet. After I passed an active construction zone where only one lane could go at a time, it was walking when traffic was going my way and skating on fresh asphalt with the lane to myself when they weren&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Last night at a gas station in Woodbine, I found a single can of Rockstar Cola, which I&rsquo;m pretty sure was discontinued a long time ago. Either way, I bought it and carried it with me across state lines and right past the agricultural inspection stop. That&rsquo;s who I am, you guys: I&rsquo;ll celebrate with an expired energy drink instead of champagne. It didn&rsquo;t even spray when I opened it, despite bumping along for all those miles.</p>

<p>As a final weird celebration, I walked three miles each way to the town shopping center to mail home all my camping gear. I&rsquo;m in a vacation state, may as well go into vacation mode and spend my nights in beachside rooms somehow. Plus, my pack feels essentially weightless as a result. Everything&rsquo;s coming up Brian!</p>
