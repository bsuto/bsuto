<p>The very morning after I redid the next couple days&rsquo; schedule, to accommodate for the heat and humidity, the temperature dropped over ten degrees and the sun went behind the clouds. So today&rsquo;s short route feels a little cheap because the weather wasn&rsquo;t oppressive at all.</p>

<p>The first leg was on a variety of trails and sidewalks, some smooth and picturesque (above), others rough and bordering golf courses. As for the second leg, I&rsquo;ve been trying to avoid the 17 as much as possible, but it was the only way into Georgetown. So I did over eight miles on the shoulder of the highway, and a for-real highway this time. There were the warning grooves cut into the road between the right lane and the shoulder, constant traffic, and nowhere to exit for those eight miles. I&rsquo;ve done some miles on the shoulder of a major road already but those were only practice for today. And now that it&rsquo;s behind me, I dunno if I can ever be scared again.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, I&rsquo;m going to go halfway through the Francis Marion National Forest (and conveniently, set up camp at the Halfway Creek campsite). I don&rsquo;t know if there will be phone service, but I&rsquo;ll still take notes and photos to post on the other side. That&rsquo;ll be the great city of Charleston!</p>
