<p>Almost all of today&rsquo;s miles were down A1A, which can be both a town&rsquo;s main drag with wall-to-wall strip malls, and an isolated highway with light traffic through oceanfront state parks. After more of the latter, I crossed a big bridge into St. Augustine.</p>

<p>I stopped at a small pizza place for lunch. On my way out, the owner asked me if I was on a big trip, since my pack had &ldquo;those serious straps.&rdquo; When I replied yes, and that I&rsquo;d started in North Carolina, I could almost see the tiny poof in his head as his mind was blown. His eyes got wide at least. &ldquo;I thought maybe you were coming from Jacksonville or something!&rdquo; When I said that Jacksonville was where I had started that morning, his mind was blown again.</p>

<p>Then I got to pass through the historic part of the city. Moving south, the first thing was the Fountain of Youth tourist trap. I didn&rsquo;t pay the entry fee so I didn&rsquo;t get to slurp any of their sulfur water, but I did use the public restrooms to pee. And as a young man still under 30, that made me the fountain of youth for a couple seconds.</p>

<p>Next was the mission and shrine to Our Lady of La Leche, with the accompanying 200ft tall cross. I skated by.</p>

<p>Finally, the big fort, Castillo de San Marcos. The dry moat and outer grounds are open like a public park, and really cool to wander around. They were charging to go inside, which I vaguely remember doing more than twenty years ago, so I opted to continue around the perimeter. It was still awesome to see the old walls and towers from the outside.</p>

<p>Then I crossed the [draw]bridge of lions to move further south and away from the tourist area. A fairly long day on the coastal roads tomorrow!</p>
