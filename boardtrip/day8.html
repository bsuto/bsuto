<h1>Day 8: Rest Day</h1>
<h2>Oct 8, 2014</h2>

<p>The sun is hot, the air is humid, and it smells like the ocean. Wilmington could be Florida if it had palm trees. Perhaps I should stay here!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I needed a rest day today, I easily could have kept going. (I&rsquo;m especially excited to ride a ferry tomorrow to get back on the mainland.) But I did fall asleep reading this afternoon, so maybe I did. Either way, the other Carolina in only two days!</p>
