<p class="caption">A tale of two roads: on the left, I-95 south with two lanes of traffic hurtling forward at 70+ mph; on the right, a frontage road with hardly any traffic in either direction.</p>

<p>Today is what a rest day should be (and maybe will be from now on). Minimal distance with good weather, so there&rsquo;s no anxiety about reaching the end before sunset or exhaustion. Even though over half of it was walking due to gritty roads, my mood was as positive as it&rsquo;s been.</p>

<p>I met my first fellow ECG traveler on the frontage road. He snuck up behind me on his bike, carrying only two small panniers and a tent. He slowed his pace to match mine, neither of us stopping altogether. We exchanged hellos but not names, starting and ending points. He&rsquo;s going the entire way, having already traveled from the north end of Maine and bound for Key West. He was still impressed that I&rsquo;d come a fraction of his distance, via skateboard. And then like that, we wished each other well and he accelerated past me back to his normal speed.</p>
