<p>I felt more sleepy today than usual. I almost took a lazy Sunday nap on a park bench overlooking the intracoastal in Edgewater.</p>

<p>At the height of my obsession with space (around the time Apollo 13 came out), my family went to Kennedy Space Center. And today I had to travel inland because this is that stretch of the coast reserved for NASA, Cape Canaveral! It meant a return to form, occupying the shoulder of a highway (this time, US 1) and cutting through a flat stretch of land with not much but the sun beating down.</p>

<p>My brother Jack is heading to Jupiter for a couple days, so I have a narrow time window for the end of this trip. This means I won&rsquo;t indulge the part of me that still wants to be an astronaut today or tomorrow, but maybe I&rsquo;ll drive a rental car home instead of flying, so I can stop back here on the way up. Harry Potter world is across the 95 from here as well!</p>

<p>Fun trivia tidbit: the area code for the Cape Canaveral area is 321. Blast off!</p>
