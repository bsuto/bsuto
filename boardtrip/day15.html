<p>For how short today was in mileage, it felt just as long as any previous day. I&rsquo;m camping tonight at what appears to be the only safe place to stop between Charleston and Yemassee, so a short trip today will be followed by a longer one tomorrow.</p>

<p>Maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t take rest days anymore. I come out of them feeling lazy and reticent to move; five of today&rsquo;s first eight miles had to be walked due to muddy gravel paths and I was just fine with that. When I had to end on the shoulder of the 17 again, I was scared and didn&rsquo;t want to, despite what I said after coming into Georgetown. To be fair, this section of 17 had just as heavy traffic but almost no shoulder width, forcing me onto the highway at times.</p>

<p>My campsite tonight is cute but I hope neither mosquitoes nor alligators disturb me. Mostly kidding on the alligators.</p>
