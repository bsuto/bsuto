<h1>Day 2: Rest Day</h1>
<h2>Oct 2, 2014</h2>

<p>At my parents&rsquo; behest (and really, common sense), Sara accompanied me to Wake Med&rsquo;s trauma center last night. They took x-rays to make sure no bones were broken, and ultimately declared I had a contusion to my thoracic spine. I got an awesome muscle relaxer that must have kicked in after I fell asleep. And then I slept for most of the day.</p>

<p>I feel much better than yesterday but still not 100%. With tonight&rsquo;s rest and a continued ibuprofen regimen, I&rsquo;m confident I can finish my original day one route tomorrow, ending up only two days behind. Let me say again, everyone needs to wear helmets! I don&rsquo;t want to think about what would&rsquo;ve happened if I hadn&rsquo;t. Even with the helmet, I got a nice red mark on my forehead at the point of impact (the photo at the top).</p>

<p>Back to sleep, and back at it tomorrow!</p>
