<p>I went 12 miles beyond what I planned to today, thanks to some of the best skating conditions I&rsquo;ve had on both trips. The sky was overcast most of the day, so the sun and heat weren&rsquo;t oppressive, and the last 17 miles were on a network of real, paved bike trails.</p>

<p>Before that, of course, I skated the shoulder of A1A coming out of Hollywood. Early in the morning, I heard a siren approaching behind me and couldn&rsquo;t figure out what to do for a couple seconds. Do I stop where I am, next to the curb? Can I maybe keep going (I&rsquo;m small!)? I ended up hopping the curb onto the sidewalk.
Between Hollywood and Miami was a short trail in Haulover Beach. There were probably a dozen stray cats lounging in the grass on the side, completely unfazed by the human traffic, and every so often a sign asking people to not abandon their pets at the beach. üòø</p>

<p>The late morning had me go through Miami Beach and then Miami proper. I didn&rsquo;t feel like stopping that early in the day, which led to me realizing that everyone else in Miami Beach is there to stay for a little while. I alternated between boardwalks, sidewalks, and the street, and everywhere there were people moving at a vacation pace. No one was pleased to have a stinky skateboarder hurry by.</p>

<p>After crossing into downtown Miami, I got lost. Who knew SE 4th street turns into SE 3rd street somewhere, instead of keeping its name the whole time? I stopped for lunch after I finally got out of the city. And after lunch and the second wind that comes with it, I spent the rest of the day on those trails. The first half was The Underline &mdash; as The High Line in Manhattan is a trail built on an old elevated railway, The Underline in Miami is a trail built under an active one. Pretty smart use of space. Maybe I should become a civil engineer for this very specific niche of bike- and skateboard-friendly urban trails, given how much they excite me.</p>

<p>Tonight&rsquo;s my last night on the mainland! Aiming for Key Largo tomorrow. The key preparation will be to queue more podcasts, which have really helped the miles pass the last two days.</p>
