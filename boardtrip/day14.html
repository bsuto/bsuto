<h1>Day 14: Rest Day</h1>
<h2 class="info">Oct 14, 2014</h2>

<p>Charleston is a phenomenal city. I wandered around the historic district for hours today, seeing gravestones and buildings from the 1700s, tourists and students alike, and an endless amount of delicious-looking restaurants.</p>

<p>I chose to eat lunch at <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/hello-my-name-is-bbq-charleston">Hello My Name Is BBQ</a>, which started as a food truck, to compare both Carolina styles side by side. I still prefer vinegar over mustard but they also had a &ldquo;green and bold&rdquo; jalape√±o-based sauce and that was real good too.</p>

<p>None of the intermittent thunderstorms forecast for today have happened yet, so they&rsquo;ll probably come as I get back on the road tomorrow morning. I&rsquo;ll be back, Charleston!</p>
