<h2>Oct 9, 2014 &bull; 48.5 miles (<a href="https://www.mapmyfitness.com/routes/view/540164238">part 1</a>, <a href="https://www.mapmyfitness.com/routes/view/540166660">part 2</a>)</h2>

<p>Whatever island or peninsula Wilmington is on sure is bigger than the map would have you think. I crossed one scary bridge over the intracoastal getting out of there, well made up for by later cruising through a beach town and reaching the Atlantic for the first time.</p>

<p>After passing through Fort Fisher, it was time to ride a ferry! I was the only pedestrian so I got to sit in a cabin with the crew while everyone else stayed in their vehicles or milled around the deck. There were two RVs and one crew member pointed out &ldquo;one has three A/C units and a TV satellite dish. Ain&rsquo;t never seen that before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then I had to say goodbye to the Atlantic and travel back inland to follow the bike-friendly highways. 211 was smooth, relatively flat, relatively free of wind, and traveled by friendly traffic. The final 10 miles, on a mix of residential roads and the main drag through Shallotte, were not as forgiving.</p>

<p>Tonight&rsquo;s my last night in North Carolina. There&rsquo;s still so much ahead!</p>
