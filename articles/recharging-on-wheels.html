<h1>Recharging on Wheels</h1>

<article>
<p>&ldquo;Kicking is the most natural of human actions. Even unborn children kick.&rdquo; I read that in a soccer magazine when I was little and it stuck with me long after I stopped playing. Lupe Fiasco&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl83mI69nX4">breakout single</a> reduced skateboarding to &ldquo;kick, push, coast.&rdquo; Put both maxims together and you have cruising around on your board as a natural extension of human instinct.</p>
<p>Or at least, that&rsquo;s how I see it. I don&rsquo;t&mdash;can&rsquo;t&mdash;do any tricks. Get me out of the skatepark, and forget about any ollies. I just want to get on a board and head for some smooth asphalt. If the wind&rsquo;s at my back and the world&rsquo;s descending in front of me, I can cruise forever. No effort, no style, just me and my thoughts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always felt comfortable alone. As one <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/03/caring-for-your-introvert/2696/">popular essay</a> put it, alone time actually restores energy for some people (myself included&mdash;never had I thought &ldquo;This person GETS me&rdquo; until I read that). So I began to purposefully observe these solitary hours as recharge time, and often they entailed a ride around the neighborhood. A Prius recharges its batteries when you apply the brakes. I recharge mine when I cruise with abandon.</p>

<p><strong>SIDEBAR:</strong> can I get a little MTV Cribs on you? I kind of see my two boards as cars. There&rsquo;s the everyday ride, like some kind of luxury sedan, and the warm-weather sports coupe. More technically: a 34" <a href="http://www.sector9.com">Sector 9</a> deck with the perfect amount of flex, 180mm Randal trucks and 68mm Avalon wheels; and then an 18" <a href="http://www.madridskateboards.com">Madrid</a> deck, tiny 77mm trucks and 71mm Madrid wheels. I don&rsquo;t know why the decks are imperial and the rest are metric. That&rsquo;s skateboarding for you &mdash; NO RULES!</p>
<p>Whether on my main board which can roll forever, or my tiny board which I can grab without a second thought, I can ride away any pent-up anxieties. Sometimes I listen to music, but that can turn into its own thing&mdash;when I bought an iPod shuffle in college, I stopped skating to class because I wanted to take the extra time to walk and listen. I never take my phone with me. If I&rsquo;m awake late at night or early in the morning, I&rsquo;ll find an empty street on a downhill and gently carve subtle back-and-forths for its entire length, over and over. It always works. I come back refreshed, clear, and calm.</p>
<p>There are other ways to recharge, of course. Sitting in bed or a comfy chair and getting lost in a story. Turning the music up loud and putting the player or the remote out of reach. Packing a backpack and going to Vegas for 48 hours (but no more). Seriously. They&rsquo;ve all worked for me. It&rsquo;s about steering your mind towards something outside your everyday life and letting it play there. For me, that will always be the simple pleasure of cruising on a skateboard.</p>
