<h1>My Setup</h1>

<article>
<p><img src="setup2011.jpg" alt="13&rdquo; MacBook Air &amp; iPhone 4" class="center">
That picture is not entirely honest. There&rsquo;s more to what I use on an everyday basis, but those two gadgets account for most of it.</p>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>My only computer is a 13" <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookair/">MacBook Air</a>, with Thunderbolt and a Core i7. It&rsquo;s the best computer I&rsquo;ve ever owned, with an incredible mix of portability, battery life, power, and storage. I usually have it away from a desk, but when plugged into the wall, I also use a Twelve South <a href="http://twelvesouth.com/products/bassjump/">BassJump</a>. For the price, size and convenience, I can&rsquo;t think of anything better. All the stuff I&rsquo;m listening to is compressed in some form and I don&rsquo;t need a crazy sound system. Its drivers aren&rsquo;t fully compatible with Lion yet&mdash;any audio from Safari crashes&mdash;but it&rsquo;s plenty capable with music. <em>(Updated 10/25/11: Version 2.0 of the BassJump drivers fixes this problem.)</em></p>
<p>Tucked away in a cabinet, there&rsquo;s a 1TB <a href="http://www.apple.com/timecapsule/">Time Capsule</a> pumping out WiFi, hosting Time Machine backups, and acting as a makeshift media server. I&rsquo;ve downloaded a lot of TV in my time, and it&rsquo;s all stored there for streaming whenever I want. I also have non-Time Machine backups of all my data since senior year of high school in a folder on there.</p>
<p>The 32GB GSM <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone 4</a> is my everything device, not just a mobile device. It&rsquo;s a phone, portable computer, e-reader, GPS device, camera, game console, MP3 player, and so on. It&rsquo;s insane. When I listen to music, I plug in the Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/in-ear-headphones/">In-Ear headphones</a> with the remote. Again, everything I listen to is compressed so I don&rsquo;t need the greatest headphones, and these are pretty comfortable with a works-as-advertised remote for skipping tracks and answering calls. No case for the iPhone.</p>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>The MacBook Air came with <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">OS X Lion</a> preinstalled. It&rsquo;s clear that the OS was made for a laptop of this size with a multi-touch surface. It all works pretty well together. <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/apps/all.html#textedit">TextEdit</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>, and <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> round out the first-party apps that I use the most.</p>
<p>From the Mac App Store, I&rsquo;ve installed <a href="http://www.pixelmator.com/">Pixelmator</a> for creating and modifying images, <a href="http://www.panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> for maintaining my websites, and <a href="http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver.html">The Unarchiver</a> for expanding compressed downloads. I also use <a href="http://www.transmissionbt.com/">Transmission</a> for downloads.</p>
<p>There are a couple things running &ldquo;behind the scenes,&rdquo; like the Unarchiver. In Safari, I have the <a href="http://hoyois.github.com/safariextensions/clicktoplugin/">ClickToFlash</a>, <a href="http://www.lastpass.com">LastPass</a>, and <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/drewthaler/jsblacklist/">JavaScript Blacklist</a> extensions installed. At a system level, I use <a href="http://www.perian.org">Perian</a> for watching movie downloads in QuickTime Player, <a href="http://dougscripts.com/itunes/scripts/ss.php?sp=needledrop">Needle Drop</a> to generate power hour playlists in iTunes as transparently as possible, and <a href="http://wafflesoftware.net/hexpicker/">Hex Color Picker</a> to help write CSS.</p>
<p>I covered the apps I use most frequently on my iPhone <a href="iphone-homescreen.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>There are a couple things I used to have installed that I realized I don&rsquo;t need anymore. For example, I got Flip4Mac when it came out to compliment Perian, but I never downloaded a single WMV file. Similarly with Perian, there&rsquo;s no real need for VLC (in my casual media usage). On the iPhone, I used to have <a href="http://edovia.com/touchpad">TouchPad</a> installed when I had a TV to plug my computer into, but that&rsquo;s not the case anymore. I still wholeheartedly recommend the app as the best in its class for using an iOS device to control a Mac.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a lot to this setup, but it empowers me to do everything I want. That&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
