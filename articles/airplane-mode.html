<h1>Airplane Mode</h1>

<p>My monthly cell phone bill is over $75, and I&rsquo;ve been paying it for over three years. That&rsquo;s enough time to get me out of the standard two-year contract, and I&rsquo;m thinking about closing my account. As I&rsquo;ve written before, my phone is not just a mobile device but an everything device. Does it lose that ability without a constant cellular connection?</p>
<p>I can test this by going into Airplane Mode, but leaving other antennas like WiFi and Location Services on. In some cases, I might need to buy a new app or service to cover the difference.</p>
<ul>
<li>Phone: I can use FaceTime to &ldquo;call&rdquo; people with modern iOS or Mac devices, and just set the expectation that my video feed won&rsquo;t necessarily be trained on my face. I can also port my current number to a Google Voice account, then forward that to a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/nyregion/30about.html">drug-dealer phone</a> for &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; calls. I used a T-Mobile pay-as-you-go phone exclusively for most of college and it wasn&rsquo;t bad at all.</li>
<li>Text messages: Again, I can rely on iMessage for people with modern iOS (and maybe Mac, in the future) devices. I can also use Twitter DMs.</li>
<li>Email, Twitter, RSS, web browsing: just wait until I&rsquo;m at home or on public WiFi.</li>
<li>Camera, music, games, books: shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem.</li>
<li>Maps: this is the tough case. I really only use this app when I&rsquo;m out of WiFi range and <em>need</em> a data connection. The most straightforward option sounds like paying ~$50 for a GPS app from a company like TomTom that includes map files with the app bundle. Not cheap, but relatively easy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Buying a pay-as-you-go phone and GPS app will probably set me back as much as one month&rsquo;s bill. There&rsquo;s the ongoing cost of phone minutes, though, and while I would intend for that phone to just be used for emergencies, I can totally see my parents redefining &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; to include regular Sutorius family updates, and that could turn costly fast.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.republicwireless.com/">Republic Wireless</a> just launched their $19/month unlimited plan, which includes minutes, messages, and data. You have to use a specific Android phone, but if I was going to resign myself to a cheap dumbphone anyway, that&rsquo;s not a bad spot at all. Without the fear of any overages, I could use a Republic phone for emergency calls <em>and</em> map data on the go, for only a quarter of the cost of my current phone bill. They piggyback on Sprint&rsquo;s network, which isn&rsquo;t terrible either. Combined with Google Voice to set restrictions on which numbers would actually be forwarded to the phone, and the ability to keep my current number, I might just go all in with this option. I&rsquo;ll certainly report back if I do.</p>
<p>The one bummer about cancelling my AT&amp;T account is that I&rsquo;m grandfathered into some pretty great stuff. I still have the $30 unlimited data plan, the $10 for 1000 messages plan, and a 10% company discount for a company that I left two years ago. I definitely won&rsquo;t get any of these back if I give them up now.</p>
