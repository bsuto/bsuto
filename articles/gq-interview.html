<h1>The GQ Interview: 26-year-old Brian Sutorius, as 16-year-old Brian Sutorius dreamed he would be</h1>

<p><strong>GQ: Thanks for having me over, and congratulations on the movie. Still number one at the box office.</strong></p>
<p>BS: Well thank you. Can I get you a drink?</p>
<p><strong>GQ: I probably shouldn&rsquo;t.</strong></p>
<p>BS: It&rsquo;s just as well. I only have Gatorade and Dr. Pepper.</p>
<p><strong>GQ: You designed this house, right? What was your inspiration?</strong></p>
<p>BS: I looked at a lot of my friends&rsquo; studio apartments and kind of went from there. It&rsquo;s a pretty small space for a house, just the kitchen, the bedroom, the bathroom, and the garage. But I park outside, so the garage can also be the living room when I have guests over.</p>
<p><strong>GQ: That&rsquo;s the room we&rsquo;re in now, isn&rsquo;t it?</strong></p>
<p>BS: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>GQ: You&rsquo;re telling me you built a glorified studio apartment on this huge piece of Beverly Hills land?</strong></p>
<p>BS: Sure, why not? Less to clean, and I have a lot of room to play sports outside whenever I want.</p>
<p><strong>GQ: What do you play?</strong></p>
<p>BS: How about we go inside.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>GQ: I can honestly say that I didn&rsquo;t expect your closet to just be racks and racks of sports shorts on hangers. You must have a pair of basketball shorts in every team&rsquo;s colors, pro and college.</strong></p>
<p>BS: This is pretty much what my dresser has looked like since I was in high school. The only difference is now I have more of them.</p>
<p><strong>GQ: You dress like you&rsquo;re going to the gym everyday?</strong></p>
<p>BS: Absolutely. You don&rsquo;t?</p>
<p><strong>GQ: That can&rsquo;t be true. I saw a picture of you dressed up at an event recently.</strong></p>
<p>BS: Well yeah, I appreciate that there are of course times when it&rsquo;s good to look good. That&rsquo;s why I have a suit in the back of my car.</p>
<p><strong>GQ: Is that your car in the driveway? A mailman truck?</strong></p>
<p>BS: Got that at a Post Office auction! It doesn&rsquo;t do too well on the highways.</p>
<p><strong>GQ: What about celebrity opulence? Do you travel or go out a lot?</strong></p>
<p>BS: The one extravagance I allowed myself was this custom Egg McMuffin machine. Any time of the day I can walk into my kitchen and press this little button. One button. ONE BUTTON! And three minutes later, an Egg McMuffin slides down this little chute. There&rsquo;s a whole closet of machinery in the next room making this happen. But all I have to do is go to Vons once a week and buy two dozen eggs, a block of cheddar, and a&hellip; a <em>tube</em> of Canadian bacon. Load them up in the special refrigerator.</p>
<p><strong>GQ: What about English muffins?</strong></p>
<p>BS: Ok, that&rsquo;s a second celebrity luxury. I have them flown in every morning from England. [laughs] Naw, I go to Vons for those too. Sometimes I get the stale ones to save money. It&rsquo;s not like you taste a difference once they&rsquo;re toasted.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>GQ: You auditioned twice for Saturday Night Live but didn&rsquo;t make it.</strong></p>
<p>BS: Yeah, and there&rsquo;s no bad blood about that at all. It let me go on to do all this other great stuff. And I keep in touch with Lorne; if I&rsquo;m ever in a position to cast a live-action Mr. Peanut, I have his number.</p>
<p><strong>GQ: Okay, one more question. What&rsquo;s a secret you want to tell the ladies?</strong></p>
<p>BS: I lost my virginity to <em>Teenage Dream</em>.</p>
<p><strong>GQ: Didn&rsquo;t that song come out last year?</strong></p>
<p>BS: I thought you said that was the last question.</p>
<p><em>You can hear Brian as the voice of Huey in the DuckTales movie, now in theaters everywhere.</em></p>
