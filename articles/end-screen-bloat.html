<h1>End Screen Bloat</h1>

<article>
<p>Last summer, <a href="http://www.everyinteraction.com/blog/bad-app-citizens/">discussion</a> peaked about the aggregate size of app updates for essentially nothing other than vague &ldquo;bug fixes and performance improvements&rdquo;. Consider Facebook, which updates its flagship app, Messenger, and Instagram all more than once a month, to hundreds of millions of users, at 100+MB each time. Aside from the impact to each user, the combined resources and power to store and deliver these bundles can&rsquo;t be negligible.</p>

<p>I wonder if the same can be said for YouTube end screens. You&rsquo;re probably familiar with these: the extra couple seconds of footage after a YouTube video with buttons to subscribe to the channel, or jump directly to another highlighted or recent video, on top of channel imaging or b-roll. I don&rsquo;t know they work behind the scenes beyond <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6388789?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en">this help page</a>, but it does look like they&rsquo;re rendered and tacked onto the actual movie file. And, speaking only for myself here, I think they&rsquo;re worthless. I rarely if ever interact with them and almost always close the tab when they begin playing.</p>

<p>Take the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNDUud96oGK5xQ9gyg913vw">Desus &amp; Mero</a><a href="#fn1" id="ip1" class="footlink">1</a> channel as an example. They air four nights a week and usually share four clips from the show the next day, each ending with a title card and end screen. As of this writing, the channel has over 93 million total views. Let&rsquo;s assume half of those views played the entire video, including the title card and end screen, at an average quality of 720p. I grabbed a recent clip in 720p using <a href="https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/">youtube-dl</a> and trimmed out the content, leaving 13 seconds of end screen footage at ~1.25MB. Multiplied by the 1,130 videos they&rsquo;ve uploaded, that&rsquo;s over 1.4 gigabytes of the same<a href="#fn2" id="ip2" class="footlink">2</a> end screen footage stored with Google. Storage space is cheap, but not free. And, multiplied by 46.5 million views, that&rsquo;s over 58 <em>terabytes</em> of bandwidth, for the same footage played over and over.</p>

<p>Of course, there were a lot of assumptions just made and the figure could be much, much lower. But it&rsquo;s still staggering to think of all the popular YouTube channels with full-quality end screens, both taking up space on Google&rsquo;s servers &ndash; propagated across their vast CDN &ndash; and streamed to viewers. Something to think about this Earth Day.</p>
