<p><img src="grump.jpg" alt="grump" class="left">I do not like them, will.i.am.<br>
I do not like those trite pop jams.</p>
<p><img src="william.jpg" alt="will.i.am" class="left">Would you like them on MTV?</p>
<p><img src="grump.jpg" alt="grump" class="left">I would not like them on MTV.<br>
I would not like them as MP3s.<br>
I do not like your trite pop jams.<br>
I do not like them, will.i.am.</p>
<p><img src="william.jpg" alt="will.i.am" class="left">Would you like to get it started?<br>
Would you like to get retarded?</p>
<p><img src="grump.jpg" alt="grump" class="left">I do not like to get it started.<br>
Isn&rsquo;t it offensive to say retarded?<br>
I do not like them on MTV.<br>
I do not like them on top 40.<br>
I do not like your trite pop jams.<br>
I do not like them, will.i.am.</p>
<p><img src="william.jpg" alt="will.i.am" class="left">Would you like them with my humps?<br>
Would you like some lady lumps?</p>
<p><img src="grump.jpg" alt="grump" class="left">Not with your humps.<br>
Not with your lumps.<br>
Don&rsquo;t get it started.<br>
Don&rsquo;t say retarded.<br>
I would not like them on MTV.<br>
I would not like them at all, you see.<br>
I do not like your trite pop jams.<br>
I do not like them, will.i.am.</p>
<p><img src="william.jpg" alt="will.i.am" class="left">Would you? Could you? With Fergie?<br>
Listen! Listen! And you will see.</p>
<p><img src="grump.jpg" alt="grump" class="left">I would not, could not, with Fergie.</p>
<p><img src="william.jpg" alt="will.i.am" class="left">You may like them. They&rsquo;re not crap.<br>
You may like them with apl.de.ap.</p>
<p><img src="grump.jpg" alt="grump" class="left">I absolutely think they&rsquo;re crap.<br>
And I don&rsquo;t think you can use periods like that.<br>
I do not like that song my humps.<br>
I don&rsquo;t want to see her lady lumps.<br>
I do not want to get it started.<br>
I&rsquo;m starting to think that you&rsquo;re retarded.<br>
I do not want them on MTV.<br>
I&rsquo;d rather watch kids from Jersey.<br>
I do not like these trite pop jams.<br>
I do not like them, will.i.am.</p>
<p><img src="william.jpg" alt="will.i.am" class="left">Beats! Lasers! Whistles! Bells!<br>
Could you like us as the music swells?</p>
<p><img src="grump.jpg" alt="grump" class="left">Not with any whistles and bells!<br>
Why do your names look like URLs?<br>
I would not, could not, with her humps.<br>
I would not, could not, with lady lumps.<br>
I will not listen to get it started.<br>
I will not because I feel retarded.<br>
I do not like them on MTV.<br>
In fact I hate them thoroughly.<br>
I do not like these trite pop jams.<br>
I do not like them, will.i.am.</p>
<p><img src="william.jpg" alt="will.i.am" class="left">Hey! I&rsquo;ve got a feeling. About tonight!<br>
Would you, could you, on a good night?</p>
<p><img src="grump.jpg" alt="grump" class="left">I would not, could not, on a good night.</p>
<p><img src="william.jpg" alt="will.i.am" class="left">Would you, could you, boom boom pow?</p>
<p><img src="grump.jpg" alt="grump" class="left">I would not, could not, boom boom pow.<br>
Not on a good night, certainly not now.<br>
Not with whistles, not with bells.<br>
I don&rsquo;t know how your music sells.<br>
Not with humps. Don&rsquo;t get me started.<br>
What are lady lumps? That sounds retarded.<br>
I won&rsquo;t watch them on MTV.<br>
I do not like your stuff, you see?</p>
<p><img src="william.jpg" alt="will.i.am" class="left">You do not like our awesome jams?</p>
<p><img src="grump.jpg" alt="grump" class="left">I do not like them, will.i.am.</p>
<p><img src="william.jpg" alt="will.i.am" class="left">Could you, would you, if you were crunk?</p>
<p><img src="grump.jpg" alt="grump" class="left">I would not, could not, even crunk.</p>
<p><img src="william.jpg" alt="will.i.am" class="left">Would you, could you, buy Elephunk?</p>
<p><img src="grump.jpg" alt="grump" class="left">I could not, would not, buy Elephunk.<br>
I will not, will not. Your songs are junk.<br>
I will not listen today or tonight.<br>
I&rsquo;ve got a feeling that&rsquo;s just not right.<br>
Not with wham bam whee or boom boom pow.<br>
Not if they&rsquo;re quiet, not if they&rsquo;re loud.<br>
I do not like what you call humps.<br>
It&rsquo;s not nice to call body parts lumps.<br>
I do not want to get it started.<br>
I can&rsquo;t believe I keep saying &ldquo;retarded.&rdquo;<br>
I do not like anything on MTV.<br>
Not you nor girls pregnant at sixteen.<br>
I do not like your trite pop jams.<br>
I do not like them, will.i.am.</p>
<p><img src="william.jpg" alt="will.i.am" class="left">You do not like them. So you say.<br>
Listen! Listen! And you may.<br>
Listen and you may, I say.</p>
<p><img src="grump.jpg" alt="grump" class="left">Will! If you will let me be.<br>
I will listen. You will see.</p>
