<h1>Uses This</h1>

<article>
<h2>Who are you, and what do you do?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m Brian, and I am a product manager at <a href="https://knowme.works/">Know Me</a> for both their apps. I also co-host the <a href="https://simplebeep.com/">Simple Beep</a> podcast with Ed Cormany, and ride <a href="/boardtrip/">skateboards long distances</a> for fun.</p>

<h2>What hardware do you use?</h2>

<p>For work-work, I use a retina MacBook Air. It replaced a very similar machine, the MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar, which went to AppleCare way too many times for keyboard, logic board, and other failures. It sits on a <a href="https://www.twelvesouth.com/store/product/curve-for-macbook">Twelve South Curve</a> stand, on an <a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/product/standing-desk">Autonomous SmartDesk 2</a>, with a Magic Keyboard and Mouse. When recording audio, I speak into a <a href="https://www.shure.eu/products/microphones/pg42usb">Shure PG42</a> microphone and listen through <a href="https://www.beoplay.com/products/beoplayh3">B&O earbuds</a>.</p>

<p>My phone is the iPhone XR. I&rsquo;m fully adapted to the full-screen lifestyle, and wouldn&rsquo;t want to go back to Touch ID and the home button. But this phone is tall and heavy. When actively using it, it&rsquo;s fantastic. When carrying it around until I can use it next, it&rsquo;s a drag. I look forward to seeing how frequently I can use the Light Phone 2 instead when it comes out this summer.</p>

<p>My skateboard equipment has changed over time. Right now I&rsquo;m fortunate to have a custom 36&rdquo; drop deck from <a href="https://www.subsonicskateboards.com/collections/factory-decks-completes/products/century-36-longboard-deck-or-complete">Subsonic</a>, mounted on 180mm Paris trucks and 75mm Orangatang wheels. I have a basic <a href="https://www.bernhelmets.com/collections/bike">Bern</a> helmet, but I&rsquo;ve backed the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/park-diamond-collapsible-bike-helmet/x/18240044#/">Park &amp; Diamond helmet</a> on Indiegogo. The ability to compress it into a water bottle-sized case is really appealing for travel, and barring any project delays or serious safety concerns, I&rsquo;m looking forward to switching to that this summer.</p>

<p>I used to (cautiously) wear the stock wired EarPods while skating or running for exercise, but my sweat destroyed them. Then I bought some sweatproof wired Yurbuds and they were just okay. When the second generation AirPods came out, I bought them and started using a sweatband. Truly wireless headphones are excellent for exercising outdoors.</p>

<h2>And what software?</h2>

<p>Here we go. I try to use as little software to accomplish as much as possible, though I have strong software opinions for someone who claims to be so basic.</p>

<p><strong>On macOS</strong>, I do a whole lot in Safari, including Gmail. Chrome feels more bloated, whether or not that&rsquo;s true anymore. I write everything from code to prose to notes in TextEdit, configured to create new documents in plain text rather than the default rich text. For any graphics work, I use Pixelmator Pro. I used regular Pixelmator for a long time and the upgrade was well worth it. And I use <a href="https://www.panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> to move files around online (including my Dropbox account, which I only use to share audio with Ed now).</p>

<p>For the podcast, I capture recordings using <a href="https://www.ecamm.com/mac/callrecorder/">Ecamm&rsquo;s Skype recorder</a> and QuickTime Player locally. I edit in GarageBand using <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2015/08/add-podcasting-plug-ins-in-garageband/">Jason Snell&rsquo;s recommended compressor settings</a>, run post-processing through <a href="http://www.conversationsnetwork.org/levelator">Levelator</a> (while I still can), and add chapters in <a href="https://overcast.fm/forecast">Forecast</a>.</p> 

<p><strong>On iOS</strong>, I also do a whole lot in Safari, including Gmail. I love <a href="http://supertop.co/castro/">Castro</a>. It fits my mental model for managing and queuing podcast episodes perfectly, and now it has all the extra effects that are table stakes for a podcast app. I&rsquo;ve used <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> since before I had an iPhone. And the <a href="https://github.com/bsuto/Pastecard-iOS">native app</a> for my side project Pastecard, which feels like a cheat because it&rsquo;s not in the App Store, and ideally its progressive web app would be good enough.</p>

<p><strong>On both</strong>, I use <a href="https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a> for Twitter and <a href="https://betamagic.nl/products/newsexplorer.html">News Explorer</a> for RSS. Concerning Twitter, it may be inevitable that I have to switch back to first-party experiences soon. It&rsquo;s the only way to vote on <a href="https://twitter.com/lebatardshow">Le Batard Show polls</a>, and they took a big step toward sanity when they made the &ldquo;turn off algorithmic timeline&rdquo; setting actually remove the other timeline junk. On the other hand, they&rsquo;re still one of those companies that issue 100MB+ updates every week with purposefully vague release notes, and I really dislike that. Concerning RSS, I&rsquo;m happy with News Explorer, but will almost certainly switch to the upcoming <a href="https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a> rewrite if and when it has an iOS app that syncs over CloudKit. That&rsquo;s what News Explorer does and I appreciate not having to use a separate syncing service from the reader app.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also &ldquo;behind the scenes software&rdquo; like extensions. On both macOS and iOS, I use <a href="https://1blocker.com">1Blocker</a> (X) and really can&rsquo;t go back to the wild, untamed Internet covered in ads anymore. I also use <a href="https://1password.com">1Password</a> on both, the buy-once model, and enjoy the system integration in iOS 12. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/castle/id1383189935">Castle</a> has been pretty good at blocking the robocalls that spoof similar numbers to mine. And <a href="https://www.backblaze.com">Backblaze</a> has my laptop&rsquo;s internal hard drive as well as my big external drive backed up safely for peace of mind.</p>

<p>Is skateboarding software, like, the clothes I wear? If so, that&rsquo;s a good wicking t-shirt and lightweight athletic shorts with pockets. I did a couple trips using <a href="https://www.keenfootwear.com/p/M-NEWPORT-H2.html">Keen</a> sandals as my footwear, and now I&rsquo;ve finally switched to a more sane choice of mesh <a href="https://www.nike.com/t/sb-stefan-janoski-max-mens-skateboarding-shoe-nnTrqP9x">Nike SB</a> shoes and Dri-Fit socks.</p>

<h2>What would be your dream setup?</h2>

<p>I loved the second-generation MacBook Air and really enjoy the latest model. I think it could only really be improved by a TrueTone P3 gamut display running at the equivalent of 1440x900 retina, instead of 1280x800. Unimaginably long battery life and no threat of keyboard failure would be nice as well.</p>

<p>My dream phone would be an X-style 5 or 4 with the guts of the XR: same camera and flash (no bump?), battery capacity, A12, speakers, the works! All the benefits of the XR but much smaller, with a notched edge-to-edge (TrueTone, wide-gamut, etc.) display.</p>

<p>If Castro adds a standalone watch app, I&rsquo;ll immediately buy the base model Series 4 watch. Combining that with AirPods and being able to leave the phone behind sounds like heaven.</p>
